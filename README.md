### PROJECT GOALS ###
The goal of this project is very simple. It serves as a simplistic, understandable, much faster port of the CWU-VKD-LAB MOEKA project. We continue on this task of creating hansel chains and reducing the number of questions asked to an expert by using the properties of monotonicity.

## TASKS ## 
We still need many things implemented.
- Heuristics for different sorting methods. For example performing a binary search on the longest chain(s) first would be very effective most likely.
- An interactive Interview implementation, and a ML interview implementation.
- A way to make the outputs interactive. This can be quite simple actually. just don't end the program after making the pdf's. Then you look at them, and call some function which updates the nodes you want to update, by looking them up in the map, and then on said node, we call the permeate classification method.
